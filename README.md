# Examples - Web Development with Node and Express, 2nd Edition

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Most of the code samples in this repo are complete, if difficult to navigate.  I am in the progress up updating the README files to make it easier to find your way around, and correct any missing documenation.  Please let me know if there's something that you feels needs additional clarification or explanation.

## Chapters

### Chapter 1

This is just an introductory chapter, with no example code.

### Chapter 2

The [Chapter 2 Examples](ch02/README.md) demonstrate a simple, minimal web server using Node only (no Express) to provide the reader a little background.

### Chapter 3

The [Chapter 3 Examples](ch03/README.md) demonstrate a simple, minimal web server using Express.
