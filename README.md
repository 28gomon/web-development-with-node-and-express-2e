# Web Development with Node and Express, 2nd Edition
## Companion Repository

### WORK IN PROGRESS

THis companion repo is currently only...half-baked at best.  Most of the substantial copy updates 2nd edition are in first draft, and now I need to turn my attention to cleaning up and documenting this repository.

This companion repository has a folder for every chapter.  While most chapters
follow a familiar formulat, each one has its own README.md file to explain any
differences.
